# What is sponsoredissues.org?

`sponsoredissues.org` lets donors on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) assign their donations to specific GitHub issues, in order to vote for which features and fixes get prioritized. I made it to help chronically underpaid FOSS developers earn more money from their work.

The example screenshot below should give you an idea about how the site works. If you would like to know more details, please read the [introduction on the homepage](https://sponsoredissues.org) and have a look at the [FAQ](https://sponsoredissues.org/faq).

# Support sponsoredissues.org and vote for improvements

I use [sponsoredissues.org](https://sponsoredissues.org) to fund its own development (i.e. "dogfooding"). 

If you want to support the project, or if you want to vote for specific features/fixes, please [send me a donation on GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/benvvalk) and then [cast your votes](https://sponsoredissues.org/benvvalk/sponsoredissues.org)!
